# Purpose and Binder Badge

This repository is public so that Binder can find it. All code and data is based on the original [LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial). This repository is a class exercise that restructures the original LIGO code for improved reproducibility, as a homework assignment for the [Spring 2023 installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, _Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science_](https://ucb-stat-159-s23.github.io/). Authorship of the original analysis code rests with the LIGO collaboration.

This project includes a tutorial about whitening, spectograms, waveforms, and matched signaling. Ultimately, the following tutorial will recreate binary black hole signal processing using LIGO data.

The website is created by cleaning the repository structure of this project and adding the following details: an installable package, tests for readligo.py, the modularized functions of utils.py, tests for utils.py, a Myst file, a Binder link, a GitHub Pages, and a Makefile.
